**Project:** Autolaku.com - Dropshipping Platform  
**Feature:** Subscription-Required Admin Registration with Faspay QRIS Payment

---

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All planned changes have been successfully implemented. The platform now requires payment before admin account activation.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **NEW FILE:** `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Registration endpoint that creates pending user + subscription and initiates Faspay QRIS payment

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Validates all registration inputs (name, email, username, password, plan)
- ✅ Checks username and email uniqueness
- ✅ Creates user account with `isActive: false` (inactive until payment)
- ✅ Creates pending subscription linked to user
- ✅ Initiates Faspay QRIS payment via `createQRISSubscriptionPayment()`
- ✅ Returns payment URL for user to scan QR code
- ✅ Automatic rollback on payment initiation failure
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/register`

**Request Body:**
```typescript
{
  name: string,
  email: string,
  whatsappNumber?: string,
  username: string,
  password: string,
  plan: 'starter' | 'basic' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  message: string,
  payment: {
    transactionId: string,
    paymentUrl: string,
    amount: number,
    currency: 'IDR',
    plan: string,
    licenseLimit: number
  },
  user: {
    username: string,
    email: string,
    name: string
  }
}
```

- ✅ Added detailed logging for account activation
- ✅ Added TODO comment for future welcome email feature

**Modified Function:** `handlePaymentSuccess()`

**Lines Changed:** 117-147 (added ~30 lines)

**Key Addition:**
```typescript
// IMPORTANT: Activate user account if it was pending registration
if (!user.isActive) {
  user.isActive = true;
  console.log('✅ Activated user account after successful payment:', {
    userId: user._id,
    username: user.username,

  });
}
```

---

### 3. **MODIFIED:** `/components/auth/Daftar.tsx`

## 🔄 Complete Registration Flow

### **New User Journey:**

```
1. User visits registration page
   └─> Selects "Akun Admin"

2. Step 1: Role Selection
   └─> User confirms admin role

3. Step 2: Name Input
   └─> User enters full name

4. Step 3: Contact Info & Credentials
   └─> Email, WhatsApp (optional)
   └─> Username, Password

5. Step 4: Plan Selection
   └─> User selects subscription plan
   └─> Sees price and features

6. Step 5: Payment Initiation
   └─> User clicks "Bayar dengan QRIS"
   └─> Frontend calls POST /api/auth/register
   └─> Backend:
       ├─> Creates pending user (isActive: false)
       ├─> Creates pending subscription
       ├─> Initiates Faspay payment
       └─> Returns payment URL
   └─> Payment page opens in new tab

7. User Scans QR Code
   └─> Uses any e-wallet or banking app
   └─> Completes payment

8. Faspay Webhook Notification
   └─> POST /api/payments/webhook
   └─> Backend:
       ├─> Validates signature
       ├─> Finds subscription by transactionId
       ├─> Updates payment status to 'completed'
       ├─> Updates subscription status to 'active'
       ├─> Finds user by subscription.userId
       ├─> Sets user.isActive = true ✅
       ├─> Sets user.licenseLimit from subscription
       └─> Saves user

9. User Redirected to Success Page
   └─> Account activated message
   └─> "You can now login" prompt

10. User Logs In
    └─> POST /api/auth with username + password
    └─> Auth checks user.isActive = true ✓
    └─> JWT token issued
    └─> Redirected to dashboard

11. User Can Generate Licenses
    └─> License limit = subscription.licenseLimit
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Problem 1: No Payment Requirement** ✅ FIXED
- **Before:** Anyone could register admin accounts for free
- **After:** Payment required before account activation

### **Problem 2: Chicken-and-Egg Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Before:** Subscription API required authenticated user (token), but user didn't exist yet
- **After:** New `/api/auth/register` endpoint creates user + subscription + payment in one transaction

### **Problem 3: PaymentForm Required Auth Token** ✅ FIXED
- **Before:** PaymentForm tried to get authToken cookie that didn't exist during registration
- **After:** Registration flow calls API directly without authentication requirement

### **Problem 4: Webhook Didn't Activate Users** ✅ FIXED
- **Before:** Webhook only updated subscription and license limit
- **After:** Webhook now activates user account by setting `isActive = true`

### **Problem 5: No Registration API** ✅ FIXED
- **Before:** No endpoint to handle admin registration with payment
- **After:** New `/api/auth/register` endpoint handles complete flow

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Inactive Accounts Cannot Login**
- New users have `isActive: false`
- Auth endpoint checks `isActive` status
- Only activated after payment confirmation

✅ **Webhook Signature Validation**
- MD5 signature prevents fake payment notifications
- Formula: `MD5(userId + password + bill_no)`
- Invalid signatures rejected with 401 error

✅ **Automatic Rollback on Failure**
- If payment initiation fails, user and subscription are deleted
- No orphaned pending accounts

✅ **Password Hashing**
- bcrypt with 10 rounds
- Passwords never returned in responses
- Stored securely in database

✅ **Input Validation**
- Email format validation
- Username format validation (alphanumeric + underscore, min 3 chars)
- Password strength validation (min 6 chars)
- Uniqueness checks for username and email

✅ **Transaction ID Uniqueness**
- Bill numbers: `AUTOLAKU-{timestamp}-{random3digits}`
- Prevents duplicate payment processing
- Links payment to specific subscription

---

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

### **Database Relationships:**

```
User (Admin)
├─ subscriptionId → Subscription (one-to-one)
├─ isActive = false (until payment)
└─ licenseLimit = 0 (until payment)

Subscription
├─ userId → User (one-to-one)
├─ status = 'pending' (until payment)
├─ paymentHistory[]
│  └─ transactionId (from Faspay bill_no)
│  └─ status = 'pending' (until payment)
└─ licenseLimit (based on plan)

License (generated by admin later)
├─ adminId → User
├─ subscriptionId → Subscription
└─ expiresAt = subscription.endDate
```

### **Webhook Processing:**

```
Faspay Webhook → Signature Validation → Find Subscription
                                        ↓
                                 Update Payment Status
                                        ↓
                                 Activate Subscription
                                        ↓
                                 Find User by subscription.userId
                                        ↓
                                 Activate User (isActive = true)
                                        ↓
                                 Update License Limit
                                        ↓
                                 Return Success to Faspay
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Payment webhook not received

**Check:**
1. Webhook URL configured in Faspay dashboard
2. Webhook URL is publicly accessible
3. Server logs for incoming requests
4. Firewall/security rules

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}'
```

### Issue: Signature validation failed

**Check:**
1. Faspay credentials in `.env.local`
2. No extra whitespace in environment variables
3. Correct formula: `MD5(userId + password + bill_no)`

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Add to webhook handler
console.log('Expected signature:', expectedSignature);
console.log('Received signature:', rawData.signature);
```

### Issue: User cannot login after payment

**Check:**
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or compass
db.users.findOne({username: 'testuser'})
// Verify: isActive: true

db.subscriptions.findOne({userId: ObjectId('...')})
// Verify: status: 'active'
```

**Manual Fix (if needed):**
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  {username: 'testuser'},
  {$set: {isActive: true, licenseLimit: 5}}
)
```
