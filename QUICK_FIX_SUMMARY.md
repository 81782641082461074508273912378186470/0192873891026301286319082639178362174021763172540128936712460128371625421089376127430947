## New Error Logging

I've added enhanced logging to help debug:

**You'll Now See:**
```
🚀 Sending Faspay payment request: { ... }
❌ Faspay API Error Details: { status: 500, isHTML: true }
⚠️  Faspay returned HTML error page (likely 500 Database Error)
```

**User-Friendly Error Message:**
```
Sistem pembayaran sedang mengalami gangguan. 
Silakan coba lagi dalam beberapa saat atau hubungi support.
```
