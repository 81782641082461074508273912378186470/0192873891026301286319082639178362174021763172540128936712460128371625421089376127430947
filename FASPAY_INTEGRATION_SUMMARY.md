## üîÑ Complete Payment Flow

The payment flow now works as follows:

1. **User registers** through `/components/auth/Daftar.tsx`
   - Form data collected (name, email, username, password)
   - Subscription plan selected

2. **Backend creates pending account** (`/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)
   - Creates pending user (isActive = false)
   - Creates pending subscription
   - Initiates Faspay payment

3. **User redirected to Faspay** for payment
   - QRIS code displayed
   - User scans with any e-wallet/banking app

4. **After payment:**
   - User redirected to `/subscription/success` or `/subscription/failure`
   - Webhook processes payment in background
   - Success page polls for account activation
   - Shows login button when account is active

5. **User can login** after account activation
   - License limit set based on subscription plan
   - Dashboard accessible with full functionality
